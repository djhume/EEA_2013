Nominal.Hydro.Waikato.Arapuni                  Head 175'
   4/6/1929   15000 Early start before the power house was finished, Auckland being needy.
     9/1929  +15000 But one of these vibrated badly and had to be run at lower load.
   7/6/1930       0 Seepage. Leakage. Cracks! Voids! Ground movement! EMERGENCY! Criticism! Censorship! Denials! Desperate recourse to all other available generation!
Nominal.Hydro.DawsonFalls                      Head 220' Dawson Falls Lodge. Mains electricity arrived in 1982.
  21/2/1935       0 Flood!

Nominal.Hydro.Cobb                             Head 1876' then 1950' after the earth dam of 107' replaced the weir and its ad-hoc extensions. Highest head in N.Z. with the water jet emerging at about a third of the speed of sound.
%There has been some excitement over two sink holes in the earth dam, noticed summer 2006/7 but they are small, dry, and appear inactive...
  26/ 1/1968             0 Harry's mistake! Generator 1 was under maintenance, and the water valve was opened. The jet blasted through the powerhouse wall, wrecked the transformer yard and deflected from the cliff behind flew across the road to splinter two trees on the far side of the river.
      1/1975             0 Drought. Shutdown to keep silt out of the works!

       1973       0 Collapse of the Johnson's flume.

       1981       . A "flashover" ruined the generator.
Nominal.Hydro.Wheao                            Head ~400' Downcanal of Flaxy.

Nominal.Hydro.OmanawaFalls                     Head 100' Underground power house.
     4/1985       0 Cotton insulation on the winding failed! I'll guess the months.
Nominal.Hydro.Glenorchy                        Head 210' Pipeline from the Ox Burn dam.
     1/1994       0 Very heavy rain caused floods and landslides. Detritus reached the roofline of the powerhouse.

       1996  240000 Volcanic ash from the 1995 Mount Ruapehu eruption damaged the turbines. Refurbished to 60MW.

     4/1996       0 Ash from eruptions at Ruapehu badly damaged the turbines
Nominal.Hydro.RoaringMeg.Lower                 Head 1000'
    11/1999       0 Flood! The control equipment was ruined.
Nominal.Hydro.Opuha                            Head 160' Overwhelmed by a flood during construction, 6'th Feb 1997. Assorted excitements follow. River flow restrictions usually limit full-power generation to bursts of a few hours at a go.
 13/01/2001       0 The washout weir washed out.
    11/2003       0 Fire destroyed the generators! Or possibly in 2005.
